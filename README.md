# Squeezing The Most Out Of Chrome

Here are the slides for a talk I did at [@GDGBristol](https://twitter.com/gdgbristol) about using some of the new(ish) features in Google Chrome:

**[Squeezing The Most Out Of Chrome](http://rawgithub.com/stucox/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/master/SqueezingTheMostOutOfChrome.pdf)**

I accompanied it with a series of simple demos:

* [CSS Filters (1)](http://rawgithub.com/stucox/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/master/filters.html)
* [CSS Filters (2)](http://rawgithub.com/stucox/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/master/filters-blur.html)
* [CSS Shapes](http://rawgithub.com/stucox/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/master/shapes.html)
* [CSS Shapes (2)](http://rawgithub.com/stucox/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/master/shapes-star.html)
* [WebP](http://rawgithub.com/stucox/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/master/webp.html)
* [Mutation Observers](http://rawgithub.com/stucox/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/master/mutation.html)
* [Shadow DOM](http://rawgithub.com/stucox/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/master/shadow.html)

The code for all of these can be found in this repo. All demo code is in the public domain, but if you use it in a demo / blog context a mention would be nice!
