Here are the slides for a talk I did at [@GDGBristol](https://twitter.com/gdgbristol) about using some of the new(ish) features in Google Chrome:

I accompanied it with a series of simple demos:

* [CSS Filters (1)](http://stucox.github.com/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/filters.html)
* [CSS Filters (2)](http://stucox.github.com/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/filters-blur.html)
* [CSS Shapes](http://stucox.github.com/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/shapes.html)
* [CSS Shapes (2)](http://stucox.github.com/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/shapes-star.html)
* [WebP](http://stucox.github.com/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/webp.html)
* [Mutation Observers](http://stucox.github.com/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/mutation.html)
* [Shadow DOM](http://stucox.github.com/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/shadow.html)

The code for all of these can be found in this repo. All code is in the public domain, but if you use it in a demo / blog context a mention would be nice!
