# Squeezing The Most Out Of Chrome

Here are the slides for a talk I did at [GDGBristol](http://gdgbristol.com) on 4tth April about using some of the new(ish) features in Google Chrome:

**[Squeezing The Most Out Of Chrome](http://rawgithub.com/stucox/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/master/SqueezingTheMostOutOfChrome.pdf)**

I accompanied it with a series of simple demos:

* [CSS Filters (1)](http://rawgithub.com/stucox/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/master/filters.html)
* [CSS Filters (2)](http://rawgithub.com/stucox/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/master/filters-blur.html)
* [CSS Shapes](http://rawgithub.com/stucox/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/master/shapes.html)
* [CSS Shapes (2)](http://rawgithub.com/stucox/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/master/shapes-star.html)
* [WebP](http://rawgithub.com/stucox/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/master/webp.html)
* [Mutation Observers](http://rawgithub.com/stucox/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/master/mutation.html)
* [Shadow DOM](http://rawgithub.com/stucox/squeezing-the-most-out-of-chrome/master/shadow.html)

Some of these only work in [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.co.uk/intl/en/chrome/browser/canary.html), with the "Enable experimental Webkit features" flag enabled via *chrome://flags*, cos it's like so bleeding edge, man.

The code for all of these can be found in this repo. All demo code is in the public domain, but if you use it in a demo / blog context a mention would be nice!
